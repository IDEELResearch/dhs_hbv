# If you try to merge the KR file with the PR file, there are four reasons why you may appear to lose cases:
#  (1) Children in the KR file will not be in the PR file if they have died (b16=.)
# (2) Children in the KR file will not be in the PR file if they are not living with the mother (b16=0)
# (3) Children in the PR file will not be in the KR file if their mother has died (hv112=.)
# (4) Children in the PR file will not be in the KR file if they are not living with their mother (hv112=0)
# might be restricted to hv103 de facto cases (kid slept in hh last night)
