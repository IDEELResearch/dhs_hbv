This project analyses survey and biospecimen data from the 2013-14 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in the Democratic Republic of Congo to describe the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus across the country. Survey data are publicly available upon request from the DHS Program. Biospecimen data were tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, results for which have been provided to the DHS Program. The code in this Github repo were used for this analysis.

# Project uses renv:
```
The packages (and all the metadata needed to reinstall them) are recorded into a lockfile, renv.lock, and a .Rprofile ensures that the library is used every time you open that project.

As you continue to work on your project, you will install and upgrade packages, either using install.packages() and update.packages or renv::install() and renv::update(). After youâ€™ve confirmed your code works as expected, use renv::snapshot() to record the packages and their sources in the lockfile.

Later, if you need to share your code with someone else or run your code on new machine, your collaborator (or you) can call renv::restore() to reinstall the specific package versions recorded in the lockfile.
```
